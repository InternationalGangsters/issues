# International Gangsters Issues
Welcome to the International Gangsters issues repository! This is the place to report bugs, request new features, and ask for help with the game.

## How to Submit an Issue
To submit an issue, click the "New Issue" button in the top right corner of this page. This will open a form where you can describe your issue and add any relevant details.

Please be as specific as possible when describing the issue. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for us to understand and fix the problem. If you are reporting a bug, please include the following information:

- A clear and concise description of the bug
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- The expected behavior
- Any error messages that appeared
- Screenshots or videos, if applicable
- If you are requesting a new feature, please include a detailed description of the feature and how it would improve the game.

## Issue Tagging
To help us better track and prioritize issues, we ask that you add the appropriate labels to your issue when you submit it. The available labels are:

`bug`: for issues that describe a problem with the game

`enhancement`: for requests for new features or improvements

`question`: for general questions or requests for help

`duplicate`: for issues that are duplicates of an existing issue

`wontfix`: for issues that we have decided not to address

## Issue Resolution
We will do our best to address all issues as quickly as possible. When an issue is fixed, we will close the issue and mark it as "resolved". If you have any further questions or concerns about the issue, you can leave a comment on the issue and we will do our best to assist you.

Thank you for your help in improving International Gangsters!
